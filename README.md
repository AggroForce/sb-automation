Starfoundry
=============

A comprehensive system of Starbound mods to automate the movement, production, and storage of materials, liquids, items, energy and data.

Mission Statement
---
We are creating the game that we want Starbound to be. However, we strive to be thematically and mechanically consistent with Starbound as it currently stands. We want to create content that feels solidly at home in the world of Starbound, and infuses that world with greater possibility for the future!

Collaboration Guidelines
---
*  Don't work on the master (or the primary dev) branch. Use a development branch that describes what you are doing, e.g. "dev-pipes"
  *  metadept will periodically merge these branches into the primary dev branch
*  Try to be consistent with starbound's existing asset structure
*  If you need to change something in a common script, work with the person in charge of it to do so

Managers
---
*  metadept - wire and tile manipulation systems
*  Healthire - liquid and item pipe systems
*  XspeedPL - entity manipulation systems and behavior scripts
*  SeveredSkullz - energy systems
