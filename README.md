sb-automation
=============

A comprehensive system of Starbound mods to automate the movement, production, and storage of materials, liquids, items, energy and data.

collaboration guidelines
---
*  don't work on the master branch. use a development branch that describes what you are doing, e.g. "dev-pipes"
*  when in doubt, try to be consistent with starbound's existing asset structure
*  if you find something missing from one of the common system scripts, check with the person in charge before adding it to make sure that we're (sort of) consistent

who's doing what
---
*  metadept is handling the common wire scripts, and also (for now) the tile manipulation
*  healthire is handling the common pipe scripts
*  XspeedPL is handling the entity manipulation scripts
